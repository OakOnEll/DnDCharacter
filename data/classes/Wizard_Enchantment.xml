        <feature>
            <name>Hypnotic Gaze</name>
            <shortDescription>Your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature.
            As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC (8 + proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier) or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.
            On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the create takes damage.
            Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</shortDescription>

            <name>Instinctive Charm</name>
            <shortDescription>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC (8 + proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple target creature are closest, the attacker chooses one to target.
            On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.
            You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.</shortDescription>

                When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that remains unaware of being charmed.
                Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on a an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spellcasting DC (8 + proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier) or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.</shortDescription>

            <shortDescription>Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.
            Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.
            Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your heart, you can't preserve it in the world.
            Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forst in all your deeds.</shortDescription>

                <name>Nature's Wrath</name>
                <shortDescription>You can invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it's choice) against your Paladin spellcasting save DC (8 + proficiency bonus + charisma modifier) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</shortDescription>

                <name>Turn the Faithless</name>
                <shortDescription>As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Paladin spellcasting DC (8 + proficiency bonus + charisma modifier). On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
                A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
                If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</shortDescription>

                <name>Searing Arc Strike</name>
                <shortDescription>Immediately after you take the attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the 1st level spell burning hands as a bonus action.
                You can spend additional Ki points to cast burning hands as a higher level spell. Each additional Ki point you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum number of ki points (2 plu sany additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level (rounded down).
                    Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki saving throw DC(8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

            <shortDescription>As an action, you create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.
            Each creature within that 20 foot radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Ki saving throw DC(8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.
            You can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increase the damage by 2d6.</shortDescription>

                <name>Abjure the Enemy</name>
                <shortDescription>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, choosing on creature within 60 feet that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Paladin spellcasting save DC (8 + proficiency bonus + charisma modifier), unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.
                On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
                On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for a minute or until the creature takes any damage.</shortDescription>

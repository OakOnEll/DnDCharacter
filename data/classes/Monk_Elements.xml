Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
                            The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.
                            As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</shortDescription>

                        <actionDescription>As an action, you can spend 2 Ki points and cast Gust of Wind- creating a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide for up to 1 minute.</actionDescription>
                        <shortDescription>For 1 minute, a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
                            The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.
                            As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</shortDescription>

                        <shortDescription>As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to choose an area of ice or water no larger than 30 feet on a side within 120 feet of you. You can change water to ice with the area, and vice versa, and you can reshape ice in the area in any manner you choose. You can raise or lower the ice's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 30 foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevetaion by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to 15 feet deep, and so on. You can't share the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.</shortDescription>

                        <shortDescription>As an action, you can spend 2 Ki points, and cast Burning Hands- hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki Save DC (8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
                            You can expend additional ki points to increase the damage by 1d6.</shortDescription>

A creature that you can see that is witihn 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity save against your Ki save DC (8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each additional Ki point you spend, and you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it prone.</shortDescription>

                        <actionDescription>As an action, you can spend 6 Ki points and cast Wall of Stone- you create a wall of stone within 120 feet of you for up to 1 minute. You make a wall up to 6 inches thick, composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</actionDescription>
                        <shortDescription>For 1 minute a wall of stone will persist. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
                            The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
                            If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.
                            The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.
                            If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</shortDescription>

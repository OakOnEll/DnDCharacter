            <name>Infiltration Expertise</name>
            <shortDescription>You can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.
            Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creature believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</shortDescription>

            Your ruse is indiscernible to the causal observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charimsa (Deception) check you make to avoid the detection.</shortDescription>

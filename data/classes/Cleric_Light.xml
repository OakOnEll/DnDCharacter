            <shortDescription>You can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy.
                When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose a disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.
                You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses after a long rest.</shortDescription>

                As an action, you present your holy symbol and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a constitution saving throw. A create takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.
                A creature with total cover from you is not affected.</shortDescription>

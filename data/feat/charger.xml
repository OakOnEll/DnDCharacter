    <shortDescription>When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature.
    If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack's damage roll (if you choose to chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).
    The target of the shove must be no more than one size larger than you. You make a Strength(Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength(Athletics) or Dexterity(Acrobatics) check.</shortDescription>

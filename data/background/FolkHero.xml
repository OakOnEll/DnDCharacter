        <name>Rustic Hospitality</name>
        <shortDescription>Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching you, though they will not risk their lives for you.</shortDescription>

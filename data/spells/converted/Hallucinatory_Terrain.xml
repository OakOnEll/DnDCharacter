    <shortDescription>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look sound and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp hill crevasse or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow a precipice like a gentle slope or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures equipment and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance. &lt;br>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

    <shortDescription>One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head and a madness glows in its eyes. &lt;br>The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. &lt;br>The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach. &lt;br>On your subsequent turns you must use your action to maintain control over the target or the spell ends. Also the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success the spell ends.

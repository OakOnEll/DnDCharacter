    <shortDescription>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:  &lt;br>&lt;br> * Weal, for good results. &lt;br> * Woe, for bad results. &lt;br> * Weal and woe, for both good and bad results. &lt;br> * Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad. &lt;br>&lt;br>The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. &lt;br>If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

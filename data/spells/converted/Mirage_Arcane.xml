    <shortDescription>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look sound smell and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp hill crevasse or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow a precipice like a gentle slope or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. &lt;br>Similarly you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise conceal or add creatures. The illusion includes audible visual tactile and olfactory elements so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately. &lt;br>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form however all other elements of the illusion remain so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

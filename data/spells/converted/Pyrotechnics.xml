    <shortDescription>Choose an area of flame that you can see and that can fit within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke.&lt;br>&lt;i>&lt;b>Fireworks.&lt;/b>&lt;/i> The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.&lt;br>&lt;i>&lt;b>Smoke.&lt;/b>&lt;/i> Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

    <shortDescription>Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. 
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one aditional creature for each slot level above 1st.</shortDescription>

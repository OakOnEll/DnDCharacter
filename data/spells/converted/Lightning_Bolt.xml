    <shortDescription>A stroke of lightning forming a line of 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. &lt;br>The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. 
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 3rd.</shortDescription>

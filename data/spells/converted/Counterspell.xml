    <shortDescription>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability.  The DC equals 10+ the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect. 
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th leve lor higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the leve lof the spell slot you used.</shortDescription>

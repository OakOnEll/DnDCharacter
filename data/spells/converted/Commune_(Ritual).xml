    <shortDescription>You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no.&lt;br>You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. &lt;br>Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive 'unclear' as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.&lt;br>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

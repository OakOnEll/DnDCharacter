    <shortDescription>Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following benefits: 
 * Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
 * You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it. 
 * You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.

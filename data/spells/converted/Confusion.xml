    <shortDescription>This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled actions. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.&lt;br>An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. &lt;br>&lt;table>&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;b>d10&lt;/td>&lt;td>&lt;b>Behavior&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td>1&lt;/td>&lt;td>The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td>2-6&lt;/td>&lt;td>The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td>7-8&lt;/td>&lt;td>The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;tr>&lt;td>9-10&lt;/td>&lt;td>The creature can act and move normally.&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table> &lt;br>At the end of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot above 4th. </shortDescription>

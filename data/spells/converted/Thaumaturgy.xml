    <shortDescription>You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range: &lt;br> * Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute. &lt;br> * You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute. &lt;br> * You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute. &lt;br> * You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers. &lt;br> * You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut. &lt;br> * You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

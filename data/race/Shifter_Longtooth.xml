        <name>Shifting</name>
        <shortDescription>On your turn, you can shift as a bonus action. Shifting lasts for 1 minute or until you end it on your turn as a bonus action.
            While shifting, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution bonus (minimum of 1).
            While shifting, you can make a bite attack as an action. This is a melee weapon attack that uses Strength for its attack roll and damage bonus and deals 1d6 piercing damage.
            If this attack hits a target that is your size or smaller, the target is also grappled.
            You must finish a short or long rest before you can shift again.</shortDescription>

    <feature>
        <name>Saving Face</name>
        <shortDescription>Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus +5).
            Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</shortDescription>

        <name>Burning Hands</name>
        <shortDescription>You can cast Burning Hands with constitution spellcasting ability once per long rest.
As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.</shortDescription>

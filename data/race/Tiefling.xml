        <name>Hellish Rebuke</name>
        <shortDescription>You  can  cast  the  hellish  rebuke  spell  as  a  2nd-level  spell  once  with  this  trait  and  regain  the  ability  to  do  so  when  you  finish  a  long  rest.
As a reaction in response to being damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see, you point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a dexterity saving throw against your Charisma ability. It takes 3d10 fire damage on a failed save, and half that on a successful save.</shortDescription>

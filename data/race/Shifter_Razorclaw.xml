        <shortDescription>On your turn, you can shift as a bonus action. Shifting lasts for 1 minute or until you end it on your turn as a bonus action.
            While shifting, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution bonus (minimum of 1).
            While shifting, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. You can use your Dexterity for its attack roll and damage bonus, and this attack deals slashing damage.
            You must finish a short or long rest before you can shift again.</shortDescription>

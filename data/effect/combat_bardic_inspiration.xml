    <shortDescription>Within 10 minutes of your receipt of the Bardic Inspiration $die, you can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.
    You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use this die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
    You can also choose to roll the die and add it to a weapon damage roll you just made, or use your reaction to roll the die and add the number to your AC against an attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.
    Once the die is rolled, it is lost. You may only have one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</shortDescription>

    <shortDescription>Within 10 minutes of your receipt of the Bardic Inspiration $die, you can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.
    You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use this die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
    Once the die is rolled, it is lost. You may only have one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</shortDescription>
